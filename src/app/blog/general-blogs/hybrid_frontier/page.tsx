Introduction:
Remember 2020? Yeah, that year. COVID hit, and suddenly we were all paranoid about touching doorknobs and working in our sweatpants. Fast forward to today—masks are (mostly) gone, hugs are back, but guess what? We're still working from our couches, coffee shops, and basically anywhere with decent WiFi. Welcome to hybrid work.
But here's what nobody tells you: every new location you log in from is a potential security nightmare. Analysts warn that hybrid environments create way more attack opportunities, and remote workers have become prime targets. The scary part? Some of the biggest breaches in recent years happened because organizations weren't ready for this shift. Let's talk about what went wrong and more importantly, how to make sure it doesn't happen to you."

Background:
“Hybrid work” generally means employees split time between office and remote locations. For example, Forbes describes a hybrid model as one where staff “spend a significant amount of time not in the office”.In practice, this means people log in from home Wi-Fi, use personal laptops or phones, or rely on cloud apps and VPNs. Each new login point – home router, public hotspot, personal device – is a potential vulnerability.In hybrid setups IT teams often cannot enforce traditional perimeter controls, so attackers exploit gaps (shared computers, delayed patching, weak Wi-Fi) to break in.As ZenGRC explains, when users connect from “various locations and devices, cybercriminals have more potential entry points,” including unsecured home networks and personal gadgets.

“Edge computing” similarly brings data processing to the network’s edge – think IoT devices, sensors, and on-prem gateways. Edge systems can speed up real-time data handling, but they also extend trust to many new devices.  However, this distributed architecture poses security challenges. Edge devices are often deployed in environments with minimal physical security – perhaps outdoors or on factory floors – making them easy targets.They also run specialized software that is hard to patch centrally. As a result, “edge devices run on software that might contain security vulnerabilities” which attackers can exploit to “gain unauthorized access to the device, the wider network, and…sensitive data”


How the Attacks Worked
Below we summarize three types of hybrid/edge-related attacks: a supply-chain breach (SolarWinds), an MSP-targeted ransomware (Kaseya), and an infrastructure ransomware (Colonial Pipeline). Each illustrates how trust in remote tools can be exploited.
SolarWinds (Dec 2020) – In this massive supply-chain attack, nation-state hackers gained access to SolarWinds’ software build system and inserted malicious code into a legitimate product update. The compromised DLL (named SolarWinds.Orion.BusinessLayer.dll) was digitally signed by SolarWinds and pushed out to customers via the normal update process. When thousands of organizations installed the update, they unknowingly gave attackers a backdoor (called “Sunburst”) into their networks. Once inside, the attackers used a sophisticated “Golden SAML” technique: they forged authentication tokens to impersonate users and escalate privileges without needing original credentials. This let them move laterally across victim networks and install additional malware (spreading to other systems or stealing data) while staying hidden under legitimate-looking processes.


Kaseya (July 2021) – The REvil ransomware gang struck at managed service providers (MSPs) by targeting the Kaseya VSA remote-management tool. Attackers exploited a zero-day chain (authentication bypass and arbitrary file upload bugs) in Kaseya VSA to inject a malicious script into the server. That “fake update” was then automatically pushed out to all endpoints managed by the affected MSPs. In practice, a single compromised VSA box could deliver ransomware to hundreds of business customers at once. Within minutes, REvil ransomware was executed on endpoints (MSP clients) across the globe. National cybersecurity agencies reported the exploit as a classic software-enabled supply-chain attack. REvil demanded $70 million in Bitcoin to decrypt the victim systems.


Colonial Pipeline (May 2021) – This was a direct ransomware attack on critical infrastructure. DarkSide (a Russian-speaking ransomware group) first compromised a VPN account belonging to a Colonial employee. The password had been reused from another breach and lacked multi-factor authentication. With that VPN, the hackers accessed Colonial’s IT network. In a rapid sequence, they exfiltrated data and then detonated ransomware that encrypted billing, accounting, and other computer systems. Though the pipeline’s OT (operational technology) network was not directly infected, Colonial preemptively halted operations to prevent spread. In the space of hours, gas delivery to much of the East Coast was disrupted. (Notably, DarkSide’s tactics closely resembled a standard ransomware playbook: steal credentials → move laterally → encrypt data and demand payment.)
Impact: 
The consequences of breaches in remote/edge contexts can be severe. Attackers may exfiltrate sensitive data (customer records, trade secrets, or private videos) and then extort or resell it. They can shut down critical operations – as with Colonial Pipeline, where offline controls led to fuel supply disruptions and emergency declarations. Recovery often involves not only paying ransoms but also forensic investigations, legal fees, and PR costs. One analysis of Colonial’s incident notes “significant recovery costs, reputational damage and legal ramifications” for the company. Even in non-critical systems, a breach of employee devices can erode trust. For example, when Ring exposed customer homes to harassment, the company’s brand suffered badly along with the monetary penalty. In short, data breaches, operational downtime, regulatory fines, and loss of customer confidence are all on the table when remote or edge assets are compromised.

Preventive Measures
Enforce Strong Authentication & Encryption: Require multi-factor authentication for all remote logins. Insist remote workers use corporate VPNs (or zero-trust VPN-like tunnels) so that home or public Wi‑Fi is encrypted. For edge devices, use TLS/SSL for all data in transit and encrypt sensitive data at rest.


Keep Software and Firmware Updated: Regularly patch operating systems, apps, and especially edge device firmware. Automated update tools or centralized patch management can ensure devices aren’t running obsolete versions with known exploits. Because edge devices may have limited update windows, plan for secure over‑the‑air updates or periodic maintenance.


Secure Networks and Endpoints: Instruct remote employees to use WPA3‑encrypted home Wi‑Fi or to change default router passwords and update router firmware. Segment networks so that edge/IoT devices are on isolated VLANs with no direct access to critical servers. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools and intrusion detection systems to monitor remote and edge assets for suspicious activity.


Implement Least Privilege and Zero Trust: Apply the principle of least privilege everywhere. For edge IoT, allow each device only the minimal access it needs. For remote users, restrict VPN or cloud roles tightly and rotate credentials frequently. Treat every remote connection or device as untrusted by default – for example, using network access controls or certificate-based authentication on devices.


Harden Device Configuration: Change all factory-default passwords on new devices before deployment. Disable unused services and close open ports. On edge devices, disable USB ports or other local access points if not needed, and use tamper-evident enclosures or locks to deter physical meddling.


Employee Training and Policies: Train remote staff to recognize phishing and to follow security best practices (e.g. reporting suspicious emails). Provide clear guidelines for home office security (secure router setup, separation of work/personal devices). Regular drills and reminders help make security second nature. Remember that many remote and edge incidents start with human error, so awareness is a critical layer of defense.


By combining these measures – robust authentication, encryption, up‑to‑date software, network segmentation, device hardening, and vigilant monitoring – organizations can significantly reduce the risk in remote and edge environments.By understanding the unique vulnerabilities of remote and edge deployments and applying sound cybersecurity practices, organizations can enjoy the flexibility of these models without sacrificing security.
