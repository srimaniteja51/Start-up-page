    severity: "Critical",
    description:
      "A massive worldwide ransomware outbreak affecting over 200,000 computers across 150+ countries, exploiting a critical Windows SMB vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) to encrypt files and demand ransom in Bitcoin.",
    html: `
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The WannaCry ransomware attack was a global cyber incident launched on May 12, 2017, which rapidly infected more than 200,000 systems across 150 countries within days. Exploiting a critical vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB protocol (CVE-2017-0144), known as EternalBlue, WannaCry encrypted data on infected systems and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin. This attack severely disrupted healthcare services, particularly the UK’s NHS, alongside affecting logistics, manufacturing, and multiple public sector operations. Despite the existence of a patch released by Microsoft in March 2017, many systems remained unpatched due to slow update cycles, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The attack underscored systemic weaknesses in enterprise cybersecurity maturity and patch management practices. Official investigations later attributed the attack to North Korean state-sponsored threat actors, though initial suspicions pointed to other state or cybercriminal groups. The attack represented one of the most destructive and widespread ransomware campaigns in history, with an estimated economic impact ranging into billions of dollars.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>WannaCry is a form of ransomware cryptoworm that primarily targeted Windows systems through the SMBv1 protocol. The root cause was the public leak of the NSA-developed EternalBlue exploit, stolen and published by the Shadow Brokers group in April 2017. Despite Microsoft releasing a security update (MS17-010) in March 2017 to fix the vulnerability, many organizations and individual users failed to apply patches. This neglect allowed WannaCry to spread autonomously as a worm, without user intervention, across vulnerable networks. The attack demonstrated the devastating potential of leaked government hacking tools when combined with widespread unpatched legacy systems. Hospitals, telecoms, and government agencies worldwide were heavily impacted, with the UK NHS experiencing a mass disruption of outpatient services and emergency rooms. The incident motivated a global call for improved patching, cybersecurity hygiene, and rapid incident response.</p>
